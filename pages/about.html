<p align="justify">My name is Evgeniy Alekseev and I'm from Siberia (seriously, I was born in <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=ru&geocode=&q=russia,+Krasnoyarskiy+kray,+Sosnovoborsk&aq=&sll=56.133333,93.366667&sspn=0.100635,0.326843&vpsrc=6&g=%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F,+Krasnoyarskiy+kray,+Sosnovoborsk&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA,+%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4+%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA,+%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%8F%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9+%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B9,+%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F&ll=56.316537,95.712891&spn=25.891057,83.671875&t=m&z=4&iwloc=A">Siberia</a>). In the global Internet (including github) I have usually nickname <code>arcan1s</code>, but in the Russian segment it is usually <code>arcanis</code>. I am a graduate of <a href="http://www.chem.msu.ru/">the Department of Chemistry</a>, Moscow State University and now I'm a PhD student and working in my University. My speciality is a theoretical chemistry (like molecular physics and some of quantum chemistry).</p>

<p align="justify">At leisure I write small applications on C, C++ and Python (and some application scripts on Shell), link to the GitHub profile may be found on the left. In order not to seem like a bearded nerd sometimes I listen music and read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jordan">Robert Jordan's</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R.R._Martin">George R.R. Martin's</a> books (or other similar). (But my friends tell me that I still look like a bearded nerd.) Music that I usually listen may be found on <a href="smb://89.249.170.38/Music/">my home computer</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">Also I'm an <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Archlinux</a> user (maybe that's why I look like a bearded nerd). And in October 2013 I became an Archlinux Trusted User:
<blockquote cite="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_Trusted_User_Guidelines/">
The Trusted User (TU) is a member of the community charged with keeping the AUR in working order. He/she maintains popular packages (communicating with and sending patches upstream as needed), and votes in administrative matters. A TU is elected from active community members by current TUs in a democratic process. TUs are the only members who have a final say in the direction of the AUR.

Link to the TU profile may be fount on the left too.</p>

<p align="justify">All contact information can be found on the left. Feel free to contact me with any questions. <br>
Oh, wait! If you will write me to ICQ or jabber you must correctly answer antispam bot's question first. The question is:
<pre>
int i = 1;
i = ++i + ++i;
return i;
</pre>
And the correct answer is '<code>5</code>' (or '<code>6</code>', as you wish).</p>
