description: I would like to inform you that I've changed site and repository URL from <a href="//arcanis.name">arcanis.name</a> to <a href="//arcanis.me">arcanis.me</a>. It was done just because ME domain is more pretty. The old URLs will be still valid till Mar 2016 (date of the domain name registration), but at the moment I've setup URL redirection to the new URL. Sorry for any inconvenience.
