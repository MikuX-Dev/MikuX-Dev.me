<ul>
  <li>I rented a <code>arcanis.name</code> domain. Now I have a normal address, as well as all white people have it. Small description of how to do it. Firstly, you should rent domain and activate DNS editing (it is called <a href="http://www.nic.ru/dns/service/dns_hosting/">DNS-master</a> for Ru-center). I pay about $30 in year. Then you should create CNAME file in your repository; this file has line with your domain name. And finally you should create two DNS records for your domain:
{% highlight bash %}
@    A   192.30.252.153
@    A   192.30.252.154
{% endhighlight %}
(Symbol <code>@</code> means you root domain.) And next wait for two hours. You may find out the result as follows:
{% highlight bash %}
$ dig domain.name +nostats +nocomments +nocmd
; <<>> DiG 9.9.2-P2 <<>> domain.name +nostats +nocomments +nocmd
;; global options: +cmd
;domain.name.                  IN      A
domain.name.           912     IN      A       192.30.252.153
domain.name.           912     IN      A       192.30.252.154
...
{% endhighlight %}</li>
  <li>Also I've created <a href="ftp://89.249.170.38/repo">my own repo</a>, which will contain some AUR packages that I'm using. Support of both architectures is planned.</li>
  <li>Since the repo requires ftp protocol, I've changed samba shared folders to ftp. The problem of access has been resolved by using mount options:
{% highlight bash %}
# read and write rights (the file has size 2 Gb)
/home/share/share.fs /mnt/ftp/share ext4 defaults,rw 0 0
# only read rights
/home/arcanis/arch/repo /mnt/ftp/repo ext4 defaults,bind,ro 0 0
/mnt/global/Музыка /mnt/ftp/music ext4 defaults,bind,ro 0 0
{% endhighlight %}
Also here is my <code>/etc/vsftpd.conf</code> configuration file:
{% highlight bash %}
anonymous_enable=YES
anon_root=/mnt/ftp
local_enable=YES
write_enable=YES
local_umask=022
anon_upload_enable=YES
anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES
anon_other_write_enable=YES
anon_world_readable_only=YES
dirmessage_enable=YES
xferlog_enable=YES
connect_from_port_20=YES
nopriv_user=share
ascii_upload_enable=YES
ftpd_banner=Welcome to arcanis
listen=YES
{% endhighlight %}
There are plans to create redirection from <code>repo.arcanis.name</code> to the needed IP address (if I'll understand how to do this)
  </li>
  <li>Also there are plans to buy a server for compiling packages and hosting the repository, filesharing and backups.</li>
</ul>
